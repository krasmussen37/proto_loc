# proto_loc | Project Overview

This project is structured into **two phases** to 1-build and 2-utilize a comprehensive analytics platform:

## Key Objectives

- **Full-Stack Platform:** Deliver a stable, feature-complete analytics platform that can run locally, mirroring capabilities of common Analytics Cloud Tech Partner production environments.

- **Simplicity in Setup:** Favor simple, well-documented configuration steps over complex automation. Some manual, well-documented, setup is acceptable to keep deployment straightforward.

- **Data Refresh Flexibility:** Enable periodic manual refresh of source data during prototyping. (Full automation of data pipelines will be handled later in a production cloud environment.)

- **Showcase & Community Value:** Provide a fork-able platform as a live example of our analytics-to-AI capabilities, useful for community demonstrations and marketing.

- **Training & Skill Development:** Use this integrated stack as a training ground for team onboarding, continuous learning, and skill validation (even as part of talent evaluation), covering all key aspects of data analytics projects.

## Phase 1: Analytics Platform Infrastructure

**Focus:** Building the core infrastructure of the analytics platform. This phase involves assembling all necessary components (data ingestion, transformation, orchestration, storage, BI, etc.) to create a full-stack environment similar to an enterprise analytics cloud platform. The outcome is a local, rapidly deployable setup that closely resembles common Analytics Cloud Tech Partner platform environments.

**Approach:** Emphasize configuration clarity and stability. Phase 1 may include manual setup steps that are clearly documented rather than fully automated scripts. This trade-off ensures the platform remains easy to understand and adjust. The Phase 1 documentation (in this `.clinerules` series) is geared towards technical users and AI coding agents responsible for setting up and configuring the system.

## Phase 2: Analytics Platform Usage

**Focus:** Leveraging the pre-built platform for analytics projects and prototyping. In this phase, users fork the repository, load their own data, and utilize the established infrastructure to develop insights, dashboards, and potentially AI/ML applications. The platform is designed to require minimal knowledge of the underlying setup â€“ users can concentrate on data analysis and solution development.

**Approach:** Ensure that the platform is easy to deploy and use. Phase 2 documentation will guide analytics engineers, BI developers, data analysts, and business users in using the tools without needing to delve into infrastructure details. The goal is to let these users quickly spin up the environment (following simple steps) and focus on working with the data. Regular data updates during this phase are supported through documented processes. Even if not fully automated, this approach accommodates evolving datasets over a prototyping cycle.
