# Phase 2: Analytics Platform Usage 🚀 **READY TO START**

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Post-Commit)

### **Priority 1: End-to-End Data Workflow Validation**
- [ ] **Execute Complete Validation**: Run the comprehensive 5-step validation workflow in README
- [ ] **Test Asset Materialization**: Use Dagster UI to materialize taxi data assets
- [ ] **Build dbt Models**: Run `dbt run --target prod` to populate production database
- [ ] **Create Superset Dashboard**: Build visualization from mart tables
- [ ] **Verify Cube Integration**: Confirm semantic layer can read populated prod database

### **Priority 2: Platform Stress Testing**
- [ ] **Concurrent Usage Testing**: Multiple users accessing services simultaneously
- [ ] **Data Volume Testing**: Load larger datasets to test performance limits
- [ ] **Service Recovery Testing**: Verify graceful restart and persistence functionality
- [ ] **Network Isolation Testing**: Confirm service-to-service communication integrity

### **Priority 3: Custom Data Integration**
- [ ] **Fork Template Creation**: Document the "right way" to fork for new projects
- [ ] **Data Source Templates**: Create templates for common data formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON)
- [ ] **Custom dbt Patterns**: Establish reusable patterns for staging and mart models
- [ ] **API Integration Examples**: Show how to ingest data from REST APIs via Dagster

## 📋 Phase 2 Success Criteria

**Core Platform Stability**
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in 48-hour continuous operation
- [ ] All services restart gracefully with full data persistence
- [ ] Complete end-to-end data flow: Raw → Staging → Mart → Visualization
- [ ] AI integration functional with sample queries and analysis

**User Experience Readiness**
- [ ] Fork and setup process takes < 30 minutes for new users
- [ ] Clear documentation for adding custom data sources
- [ ] Example workflows demonstrate full platform capabilities
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers common issues and solutions
