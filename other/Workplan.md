# Phase 1: Platform Infrastructure

## Key Open Milestones

### **1. Housekeeping & Pre-flight Checks**
- [x] **Isolate Cube Service**: Comment out the `cube` service in `docker-compose.yml` to prevent build failures while we debug dependency issues
- [x] **Validate dbt Service**: Run a `dbt --version` check within the container to confirm it's operational (dbt-core 1.9.0 with duckdb plugin working)
- [x] **Cleanup Test Artifacts**: Remove the temporary `test_runner` service and its associated files (`other/docker/test_runner`)

### **2. End-to-End Pipeline Validation (NYC Taxi Data)**

#### **Data Integration (Dagster)**
- [x] **Document Data Integration Standards**: Populate `00_clinerules/04_data_integration.md` with Dagster ingestion patterns and DuckDB connection standards
- [x] **Dagster Asset - Taxi Trips**: Create a Dagster asset to read all `yellow_tripdata_*.parquet` files from `01_source_data/nyc_yellow_taxi_demo_data/yellow_cab_data_monthly/` and load them into a single `raw_taxi_trips` table in `raw.duckdb`
- [x] **Dagster Asset - Taxi Zones**: Create a second Dagster asset to read `taxi_zone_lookup.csv` from `01_source_data/nyc_yellow_taxi_demo_data/taxi_zones/` and load it into a `raw_taxi_zones` table in `raw.duckdb`
- [ ] **Test Dagster Ingestion**: Materialize both assets via Dagster UI and verify data loaded correctly

#### **Data Transformation (dbt)**
- [ ] **Document Data Modeling Standards**: Populate `00_clinerules/06_data_modeling_and_semantic_layer.md` with database, schema, and table naming conventions
- [ ] **dbt Staging Models**: Create dbt models to clean and prepare the raw data, materializing them as `stg_taxi_trips` and `stg_taxi_zones` in the `stg` schema of `dev.duckdb`
- [ ] **dbt Mart Models**: Create final dbt models for analytics, materializing them as `fct_taxi_trips` and `dim_taxi_zones` in the `mart` schema of `dev.duckdb`
- [ ] **Test dbt Pipeline**: Run `dbt run` and `dbt test` to validate all transformations

#### **Data Visualization (Superset)**
- [ ] **Document Visualization Standards**: Populate `00_clinerules/07_data_visualization.md` with Superset connection and dashboard standards
- [ ] **Connect Superset to DuckDB**: Configure Superset to connect to `dev.duckdb` and access mart tables
- [ ] **Create Sample Dashboard**: Build a simple dashboard with 2-3 charts visualizing taxi trip data (e.g., trips over time, popular pickup zones)
- [ ] **Validate End-to-End Pipeline**: Confirm data flows from raw files → DuckDB → Superset visualization

### **3. Resolve Outstanding Platform Issues**
- [ ] **Debug Cube.js Dependencies**: Systematically investigate and resolve the `npm install` failures for the `cube` service
- [ ] **Update Cube Dependencies**: Pin all `@cubejs-backend/*` packages to a known stable version that builds successfully
- [ ] **Re-enable Cube Service**: Uncomment the `cube` service in `docker-compose.yml` and confirm successful build and startup
- [ ] **Test Cube Integration**: Create a simple cube definition connecting to mart tables

## Key Milestones Completed
- **Platform Stability and Persistence**: Implemented Docker volumes and health checks to ensure services are stable and data persists across restarts
- **Dependency Resolution**: Fixed all Python dependency conflicts across Dagster, Superset, and Jupyter services for stable builds
- **Containerized Test Suite**: Developed an isolated test environment to validate the platform's stability without affecting the local machine
- **Enhanced Code Documentation**: Added comprehensive comments to Docker configurations and established clear repository structure

# Phase 2: Analytics Platform Usage

## Key Open Milestones
- **Custom Data Sources**: Enable users to fork the repository and easily load their own data sources following established patterns
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboards**: Expand Superset capabilities with complex visualizations, drill-down functionality, and user management
- **AI/ML Model Integration**: Implement comprehensive PandasAI workflows and integrate custom ML models via Jupyter
- **Production Deployment**: Create deployment guides and configurations for cloud environments

## Key Milestones Completed
- (Phase 2 has not yet begun - Phase 1 pipeline validation is prerequisite)
