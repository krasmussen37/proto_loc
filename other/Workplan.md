# Phase 1: Platform Infrastructure

## Key Open Milestones

### **1. End-to-End Pipeline Validation (NYC Taxi Data)**

#### **Data Integration (Dagster)**
- [x] **Document Data Integration Standards**: Populate `00_clinerules/04_data_integration.md` with Dagster ingestion patterns and DuckDB connection standards
- [x] **Dagster Asset - Taxi Trips**: Create a Dagster asset to read all `yellow_tripdata_*.parquet` files from `01_source_data/nyc_yellow_taxi_demo_data/yellow_cab_data_monthly/` and load them into a single `raw_taxi_trips` table in `raw.duckdb`
- [x] **Dagster Asset - Taxi Zones**: Create a second Dagster asset to read `taxi_zone_lookup.csv` from `01_source_data/nyc_yellow_taxi_demo_data/taxi_zones/` and load it into a `raw_taxi_zones` table in `raw.duckdb`
- [ ] **Test Dagster Ingestion**: Materialize both assets via Dagster UI and verify data loaded correctly

#### **Data Transformation (dbt)**
- [ ] **Document Data Modeling Standards**: Populate `00_clinerules/06_data_modeling_and_semantic_layer.md` with database, schema, and table naming conventions
- [ ] **dbt Staging Models**: Create dbt models to clean and prepare the raw data, materializing them as `stg_taxi_trips` and `stg_taxi_zones` in the `stg` schema of `dev.duckdb`
- [ ] **dbt Mart Models**: Create final dbt models for analytics, materializing them as `fct_taxi_trips` and `dim_taxi_zones` in the `mart` schema of `dev.duckdb`
- [ ] **Test dbt Pipeline**: Run `dbt run` and `dbt test` to validate all transformations

#### **Advanced BI Features**
- [ ] **Create Comprehensive Dashboard**: Build advanced dashboard with multiple chart types, filters, and drill-down capabilities
- [ ] **Test Cross-Database Queries**: Validate querying across raw, dev, and prod databases within Superset

### **2. Platform Hardening & Modernization**
- [ ] **Technology Stack Version Review**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of current tool versions (Python, DuckDB, Dagster, dbt, Superset, PandasAI) vs. latest stable releases, with upgrade recommendations and risk assessment
- [ ] **Version Upgrade Implementation**: Execute approved version upgrades based on research findings
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics for the updated stack

### **3. Resolve Outstanding Platform Issues**
- [ ] **Debug Cube.js Dependencies**: Systematically investigate and resolve the `npm install` failures for the `cube` service
- [ ] **Update Cube Dependencies**: Pin all `@cubejs-backend/*` packages to a known stable version that builds successfully
- [ ] **Re-enable Cube Service**: Uncomment the `cube` service in `docker-compose.yml` and confirm successful build and startup
- [ ] **Test Cube Integration**: Create a simple cube definition connecting to mart tables

## Key Milestones Completed ✅

### **Platform Infrastructure & Stability**
- **✅ Complete Docker Containerization**: All services (Dagster, dbt, Superset, Jupyter) running in isolated containers with proper networking
- **✅ Data Persistence**: Implemented named Docker volumes for Dagster and Superset to persist data across container restarts
- **✅ Service Health Monitoring**: Added comprehensive health checks, particularly for Superset with 90-second startup grace period
- **✅ Dependency Resolution**: Resolved all Python and Node.js dependency conflicts for stable, reproducible builds
- **✅ Repository Organization**: Established clean project structure with comprehensive `.gitignore` and proper file organization

### **DuckDB Integration & Multi-Service Connectivity**
- **✅ DuckDB Multi-Environment Setup**: Successfully configured three separate DuckDB instances (raw, dev, prod) with proper schema organization
- **✅ DuckDB Driver Integration**: Installed and configured `duckdb==1.1.3` and `duckdb_engine` SQLAlchemy connector in Superset
- **✅ Container Permission Resolution**: Fixed Docker volume mount permissions by running Superset as root user to access host-mounted DuckDB files
- **✅ Concurrent Access Configuration**: Resolved DuckDB file locking issues by removing read-only volume mounts and implementing proper connection configuration

### **Superset BI Platform Complete Integration**
- **✅ Superset Service Operational**: Superset 4.0.2 running stably on port 8088 with admin/admin default credentials
- **✅ All DuckDB Connections Established**: Successfully connected proto_loc_raw, proto_loc_dev, and proto_loc_prod databases to Superset
- **✅ Read-Only Connection Configuration**: Implemented proper `connect_args` with `read_only: true` to prevent database locking between services
- **✅ End-to-End Connectivity Validated**: Confirmed data flows from DuckDB → Superset with successful chart creation and data exploration
- **✅ Sample Data Available**: NYC taxi dataset loaded and accessible through Superset for dashboard development

### **DevSecOps & Code Quality**
- **✅ Automated Testing Framework**: Containerized test suite for platform stability validation
- **✅ Code Documentation**: Comprehensive inline comments and Docker configuration documentation
- **✅ Git Repository Standards**: Proper `.gitignore`, licensing (MIT), and README with complete setup instructions
- **✅ Environment Configuration**: Secure `.env` pattern for API keys with example template
