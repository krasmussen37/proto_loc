# Phase 1: Platform Infrastructure

## Key Open Milestones

### **1. End-to-End Pipeline Validation (NYC Taxi Data)**

#### **Data Integration (Dagster)**
- [x] **Document Data Integration Standards**: Populate `00_clinerules/04_data_integration.md` with Dagster ingestion patterns and DuckDB connection standards
- [x] **Dagster Asset - Taxi Trips**: Create a Dagster asset to read all `yellow_tripdata_*.parquet` files from `01_source_data/nyc_yellow_taxi_demo_data/yellow_cab_data_monthly/` and load them into a single `raw_taxi_trips` table in `raw.duckdb`
- [x] **Dagster Asset - Taxi Zones**: Create a second Dagster asset to read `taxi_zone_lookup.csv` from `01_source_data/nyc_yellow_taxi_demo_data/taxi_zones/` and load it into a `raw_taxi_zones` table in `raw.duckdb`
- [ ] **Test Dagster Ingestion**: Materialize both assets via Dagster UI and verify data loaded correctly

#### **Data Transformation (dbt)**
- [x] **Document Data Modeling Standards**: Populate `00_clinerules/06_data_modeling_and_semantic_layer.md` with database, schema, and table naming conventions
- [ ] **dbt Staging Models**: Create dbt models to clean and prepare the raw data, materializing them as `stg_taxi_trips` and `stg_taxi_zones` in the `stg` schema of `dev.duckdb`
- [ ] **dbt Mart Models**: Create final dbt models for analytics, materializing them as `fct_taxi_trips` and `dim_taxi_zones` in the `mart` schema of `dev.duckdb`
- [ ] **Test dbt Pipeline**: Run `dbt run` and `dbt test` to validate all transformations

#### **Advanced BI Features**
- [ ] **Create Comprehensive Dashboard**: Build advanced dashboard with multiple chart types, filters, and drill-down capabilities
- [ ] **Test Cross-Database Queries**: Validate querying across raw, dev, and prod databases within Superset

### **2. Platform Hardening & Modernization**
- [ ] **Technology Stack Version Review**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of current tool versions (Python, DuckDB, Dagster, dbt, Superset, PandasAI) vs. latest stable releases, with upgrade recommendations and risk assessment
- [ ] **Superset 5.0.0 Upgrade & Redis Integration**: Upgrade from Superset 4.0.2 to 5.0.0 and integrate Redis for performance caching to replace in-memory cache with production-grade solution
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code**: Automate Superset database connection setup via API to eliminate manual UI configuration steps
- [ ] **Version Upgrade Implementation**: Execute approved version upgrades based on research findings
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics for the updated stack

### **3. Complete Sourcegraph MCP Server Integration**
- [x] **MCP Server Infrastructure**: Successfully configured Sourcegraph MCP server with full file retrieval capability and authentication
- [x] **GraphQL Schema Resolution**: Fixed all GraphQL schema errors (field names, parameter usage, syntax issues)
- [x] **API Communication**: Established proper communication with Sourcegraph API returning well-formed responses
- [x] **VS Code Integration Issue Resolution**: Successfully resolved Cline sidebar visibility issues using "Reset View Locations" command
- [ ] **Search Functionality Completion**: Investigate web UI vs GraphQL API differences - web UI shows 418 results while API returns empty arrays
- [ ] **Query Syntax Investigation**: Test minimal queries, streaming API endpoint (`/stream` vs GraphQL), and exact web UI query parameters
- [ ] **Alternative Search Methods**: If needed, implement streaming API integration to match web UI functionality

### **4. Resolve Outstanding Platform Issues**
- [ ] **Debug Cube.js Dependencies**: Systematically investigate and resolve the `npm install` failures for the `cube` service
- [ ] **Update Cube Dependencies**: Pin all `@cubejs-backend/*` packages to a known stable version that builds successfully
- [ ] **Re-enable Cube Service**: Uncomment the `cube` service in `docker-compose.yml` and confirm successful build and startup
- [ ] **Test Cube Integration**: Create a simple cube definition connecting to mart tables

- **✅ Container Permission Resolution**: Fixed Docker volume mount permissions by running Superset as root user to access host-mounted DuckDB files
- **✅ Concurrent Access Configuration**: Resolved DuckDB file locking issues by removing read-only volume mounts and implementing proper connection configuration

### **Superset BI Platform Complete Integration**
- **✅ Superset Service Operational**: Superset 4.0.2 running stably on port 8088 with admin/admin default credentials
- **✅ All DuckDB Connections Established**: Successfully connected proto_loc_raw, proto_loc_dev, and proto_loc_prod databases to Superset
- **✅ Read-Only Connection Configuration**: Implemented proper `connect_args` with `read_only: true` to prevent database locking between services
